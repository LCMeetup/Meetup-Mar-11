Top 6 Take-Aways
1. Programming at it's core should be about the code you write, not you. 
2. Along those lines, how you came to coding matters less than the code you produce. 
3. It's ok to mess up!
4. You will look at a task, see all of the things you do not know, learn those things, and accomplish the task. When you look at the next task and all of those things you do not know, then you will realize that you are starting with more knowledge than you had when you started your last task and that everyone feels this way.
5. The challenges you face in a technical interview will not be nearly as memorable as the challenges you face on the job.
6. Some workplaces can be crazy fun!
